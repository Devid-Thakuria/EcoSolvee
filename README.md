# EcoSolvee
1. What is EcoSolve?
EcoSolve is a platform that helps local communities find solutions to environmental problems. It connects people with experts and resources so they can work together to make their neighborhoods cleaner and greener.

2. The Problem
Overlooked Issues: Many local environmental problems are ignored because people don’t have the tools or knowledge to deal with them.

No Expert Help: Communities often don't know where to find expert advice for solving these problems.

Old Methods Don’t Work: Traditional top-down approaches (decisions made by outsiders) often don’t involve the local people, so the solutions don’t last.

Connect Problems with Solutions: Help communities find the right way to fix their environmental issues.

Make Expert Help Available: Give direct access to environmental experts and useful tools.

Example: In Camden, NJ, community clean-up projects helped reduce pollution and made neighborhoods better.
